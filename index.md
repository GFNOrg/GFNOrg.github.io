# Introduction

<img src="{{ site.logo }}" style="width:400px;vertical-align:middle;padding-right:30px;padding-bottom:30px;float:left">

Welcome to the Mila GFlowNet Workshop! During this workshop, we will explore the fascinating world of generative flow networks (GFlowNets). GFlowNets are a powerful framework that is related to concepts from Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, reinforcement learning, generative models, and amortized variational methods. GFlowNets are trained to take sequential actions to sample from a distribution specified by an energy function or reward function, allowing us to generate complex objects through a sequence of steps. GFlowNets have been applied to a variety of domains, including molecule and protein design, causal discovery, and combinational optimization, as well as to augment the capabilities of generative models for vision and language.

Throughout the workshop, we will discuss the background, theoretical foundations, techniques, and applications of GFlowNets, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of this exciting field. We hope you enjoy the workshop and find inspiration in the potential of generative flow networks.
