# Introduction

Welcome to the GFlowNets workshop! During this workshop, we will explore the fascinating world of Generative Flow Networks (GFN). GFNs are a powerful framework that is related to concepts from Monte-Carlo Markov chain methods, reinforcement learning, generative models, and amortized variational methods. GFNs are designed to sample from a distribution specified by an energy function, allowing, allowing us to generate complex objects through a sequence of steps. They learn to represent and sample from a distribution by training a policy that generates objects with a probability proportional to a reward function or energy function.

Throughout the workshop, we will discuss the backgrounds, theoretical foundations, techniques, and applications of GFNs, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of this exciting field. We hope you enjoy the workshop and find inspiration in the potential of Generative Flow Networks.
