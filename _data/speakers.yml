  bio: "Recognized worldwide as one of the leading experts in artificial intelligence, Yoshua Bengio is most known for his pioneering work in deep learning, earning him the 2018 A.M. Turing Award, “the Nobel Prize of Computing,” with Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun.

  He is a Full Professor at Université de Montréal, and the Founder and Scientific Director of Mila – Quebec AI Institute. He co-directs the CIFAR Learning in Machines & Brains program as Senior Fellow and acts as Scientific Director of IVADO.

  In 2019, he was awarded the prestigious Killam Prize and in 2022, became the computer scientist with the highest h-index in the world. He is a Fellow of both the Royal Society of London and Canada, Knight of the Legion of Honor of France and Officer of the Order of Canada.

  Concerned about the social impact of AI and the objective that AI benefits all, he actively contributed to the Montreal Declaration for the Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence."

  title: "AI to explore molecular space and fight pandemics and climate change"
  abstract: "Machine learning research is expanding its reach, beyond the traditional realm of the tech industry and into the activities of other scientists, opening the door to truly transformative advances in these disciplines. In this lecture I will focus on two aspects, modeling and experimental design, that are intertwined in the theory-experiment-analysis active learning loop that constitutes a core element of the scientific methodology. Computers will be necessary to go beyond the currently purely manual research loop and take advantage of high-throughput experimental setups and large-scale experimental datasets. I will discuss methods related to active learning, reinforcement learning, generative modeling, Bayesian ML, amortized variational learning and causal discovery. I will discuss the notion of epistemic uncertainty and how to estimate it. I will motivate generative policies that can sample a diverse set of candidate solutions to a problem, be it for proposing new experiments or causal hypotheses. Finally, I will describe current research to help us with these questions based on a new deep learning probabilistic framework called GFlowNets and how we plan to apply these in areas of great societal need like the unmet challenge of antimicrobial resistance or the discovery of new materials to help fight climate change."
